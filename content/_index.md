Hello, stranger! 👋🏻 My name is Lenon. Welcome to my blog!

I started this blog to share my thoughts and discoveries about software engineering. Here, I expect
to write about programming with Ruby and Python, among other languages. I am also interested in
scaling systems, deployment strategies, continuous integration, and delivery, so I’ll be writing
about tools and concepts such as Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, among others.
