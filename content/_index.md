Iâ€™m a Software Engineer, and this is my blog. Welcome!

I started this blog to share my thoughts and discoveries about software
engineering. Here, I expect to write about programming with Ruby, Python, and
Clojure, among other languages. I am also interested in scaling systems,
deployment strategies, continuous integration, and delivery, so Iâ€™ll be writing
about tools and concepts like Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, among others.
